            <section class='descrp-container'>
                <p>I am 21 years old and at the moment I'm in the 4th year of the Masters Degree on Computer Science at FEUP
                    (Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto). </p>
                <p>I am a code lover. My favorite computer science areas are network security,
                    web development and operating systems. </p>
                <p>Throughout these years in college I've been involved in numerous projects
                    which are mentioned in the 'My Projects' area that gave me the "thirst" for more allowing me to become more and more interested in developing my own personal projects like this website.</p>
                <p>I am continuously trying to evolve myself looking for
                    new challenges and experiences.</p>
                <p>My main hobbies are playing guitar, kickboxing and to travel.</p>

                        <h4>AEDA course - FEUP</h4>
                        <p>This project was done in the year of 2017 during the AEDA (Data Structures and Algorithms) course classes. It was fully written by me and
                            <a href='#'>João Amaral</a> in C++.
                        </p>
                        <p>AEDA is a course where data structures and the notion of time and memory complexity of algorithms are introduced as well as object-oriented programming. 
                            Its main purpose is for students to be capable of modulating problems recorring to OOP paradigms as well as linear and non-linear data structures
                        </p>
                        <p>The problem was to implement a management software for a moving company. The company had three types of clients: corporate, particulars
                            and also non-registered clients. With these specifications and a lot of restrictions like type of payment, discounts and prices for each service
                            we had to write a well-sustained software where was no room for errors.
                        </p>
                        <p>Part 1</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this part was to implement the basis of the software operation like a client be able to make requests, the software to generate prices
                            according to the packaging, shipping and delivery costs of the products and also to apply discounts depending on the client´s  payment option.</p>
                        <p>Part 2</p>
                        <p>The second part was to add features using data structures. Some of the data structures we have chosen to use were:</p>
                        <p>Hash tables</p>
                        <p>Binary search trees (BST's)</p>
                        <p>Priority Queues</p>
                        <p>You can have a look at the source code which is hosted in my github repo.</p>

                            This project was written by me and <a href='#'>Dinis Moreira</a> during the LPOO course classes (Object-Oriented Programming Lab) 
                            in the year of 2017. It was written in Java and with LibGDX (framework for physics in game development). All concept and ideas were
                            also designed by us.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is a desktop game where the user has to play against the PC. The purpose of the game is to last the most possible time
                            without being hit by the enemies (PC).
                        </p>
                        <p>The user is represented by a spaceship which can shoot bullets and dodge the incoming bullets (up / down) from the enemies.</p>
                        <p>The enemies are also spaceships which shoot and continuously try to shoot down the spaceship.</p>
                        <p>The project also has AI so that the enemies can adapt their functions to the game difficulty and to try to shoot the user down.</p>
                        <p>The source code is in my github repo: here.</p>
